# Heterogeneity_classifier
This is the code used in the ["Scale‑Independent Rock Heterogeneity Classification Algorithm Applied to Microtomography Images"](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11242-023-02008-1) publication. 

To start with the code, download the repository and extract the "Data.zip" file. This training data, along with others, can be found on the [Digital Rocks Portal](https://www.digitalrocksportal.org). 

When opening the "Vsi_tutorial.ipynb" notebook, everything should run smoothly. If "Vsi_tutorial.ipynb" notebook is moved to another directory, one should use 
```python
- import sys
- sys.path.insert(0,Path_to_Vsi)
```
